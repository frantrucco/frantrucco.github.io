## About me

Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Groningen working under the supervision of Helle Hansen and Revantha Ramanayake.

I am investigating certain logical properties of modal logics such as Propositional Dynamic Logic and Game Logic through proof theoretical means. More specifically, I am interested in cyclic proofs, interpolation properties, and complexity results.

But this is all very specific. More broadly, I am very passionate about the history of logic, proof theory, complexity theory, the philosophy of mathematics, the practice of mathematics (as in sociology&philosophy), and philosophical logic. But naturally, my knowledge of those fields is quite limited. But I am always happy to learn more about them!
