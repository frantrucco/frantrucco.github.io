## About me

Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Groningen working under the supervision of Helle Hansen and Revantha Ramanayake.

I am investigating certain logical properties of modal logics such as Propositional Dynamic Logic and Game Logic through proof theoretical means. More specifically, I am interested in cyclic proofs, interpolation properties, and complexity results.

But this is all very specific. More broadly, I am very passionate about the history of logic, proof theory, complexity theory, the philosophy of mathematics, the practice of mathematics, and philosophical logic. But naturally, my knowledge of those fields is quite limited. But I am always happy to learn more about them!
